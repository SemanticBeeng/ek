### Definition

#### Def #1
> A random variable—unlike a normal variable—does not have a specific value, but rather a range of values and a density that gives different probabilities of obtaining values for each subset. This can be used to model uncertainty, whether from incomplete or simplified models. Random variables are used extensively in areas such as social science, science, engineering, and finance.
